# Random Quote-Generator
 Tech Degree Project 1
 
 This is a random quotation generator that was created using JavaScript. It generates a random number which is used to select a quotation from an array of JavaScript objects. It then displays the quote, along with its author to the pages. The quote generator is triggered via a button with an event listener attached.
